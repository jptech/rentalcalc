## üìä Calculation Methodology

### Mortgage Calculations
- **Standard Amortization Formula**: `M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1]`
  - P = Principal (loan amount)
  - r = Monthly interest rate
  - n = Number of payments

- **Loan Balance Tracking**: Accurate principal reduction over time
- **Interest/Principal Split**: Calculated from amortization schedule

### Tax Calculations
- **Depreciation**: Residential property depreciated over 27.5 years
  - Only building value (80% of property) is depreciated
  - Land is not depreciable

- **Deductible Expenses**:
  - Mortgage interest
  - Operating expenses (management, maintenance, utilities)
  - Property taxes and insurance
  - Depreciation

- **Tax Savings**: `Tax Benefit = Tax Bracket √ó (Deductible Expenses - Income)`

### Opportunity Cost Analysis
- **Hold Property Scenario**:
  - Net proceeds from future sale
  - Plus cumulative cash flows
  - Minus taxes on capital gains

- **Sell & Invest Scenario**:
  - Current equity minus selling costs
  - Compounded at alternative return rate
  - No property income (property is sold)

### Return Metrics
- **Cash-on-Cash Return**: `Annual Cash Flow / Total Investment √ó 100`
- **Cap Rate**: `NOI / Property Value √ó 100`
- **Annualized Return**: Geometric mean return over analysis period
